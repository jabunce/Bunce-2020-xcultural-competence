Analysis of the theoretical model is contained in Wolfram Mathematica notebooks available as "Releases" in this repository.
(Select "Releases" to the right of the screen, and then "Assets".) These make Equations 17-32 in the Appendix, Figures 1b and 2, and Appendix Figures A7, A9-A17, A20-A32.


Analysis of the empirical data using logistic regression in R and Stan is contained in the folder ``empirical-analysis-logistic-regression``. Please see the accompanying file ``README_logreg.md`` in that folder. This makes Appendix Figures A1, A3, and A4.


Analysis of the empirical data using item-response theory (IRT) models in R and Stan is contained in the folder ``empirical-analysis-IRT``. Please see the accompanying file ``README-IRT.md`` in that folder. This makes Figure 1A and Appendix Figures A2, A5, and A6.


Analysis using the empirical data to estimate values of parameters in the theoretical model, using R and Stan, is contained in the folder ``parameter-estimation``. Please see the accompanying file ``README_parameters.md`` in that folder. This makes Appendix Figures A18 and A19.
