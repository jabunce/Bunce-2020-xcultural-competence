Analysis of the theoretical model is contained in Wolfram Mathematica notebooks available as "Releases" in this repository.
(Select "Releases" to the right of the screen, and then "Assets".) These make Equations 17-32 in the Appendix, Figures 1b and 2, and Appendix Figures S9-S12, S15-S19, and S21-S25.


Analysis of the empirical data using logistic regression in R and Stan is contained in the folder ``empirical-analysis-logistic-regression``. Please see the accompanying file ``README_logreg.md`` in that folder. This makes Appendix Figures S1, S3, and S4.


Analysis of the empirical data using item-response theory (IRT) models in R and Stan is contained in the folder ``empirical-analysis-IRT``. Please see the accompanying file ``README-IRT.md`` in that folder. This makes Figure 1A and Appendix Figures S2, S5, and S6.


Analysis using the empirical data to estimate values of parameters in the theoretical model, using R and Stan, is contained in the folder ``parameter-estimation``. Please see the accompanying file ``README_parameters.md`` in that folder. This makes Appendix Figures S13 and S14.
