This analysis uses the empirical data to estimate values of parameters in the theoretical model, corresponding to Appendix Figures A18 and A19.


Steps to reproduce the analysis in this paper:

1) Create a project folder on your machine. Name it whatever you want.

2) Inside this project folder, put the file ``RunAll.R``

3) Also inside the project folder, create three sub-folders named (exactly) ``Code``, ``Plots``, and ``Data``

4) Inside the ``Data`` folder, put the file ``Manu_perceptions_28aug20.csv``

5) Inside the ``Code`` folder, put all the other files.

6) Open the file ``RunAll.R``. Inside it, you can set the path to your project folder. Then run its parts in order in R.

Figures will appear in the ``Plots`` folder.
